Tech Spec and design decisions:

*Big main nav bar is present in all webpages with the logo clearly visible to inforce brand recognition. This is added as a header
using php include.(z-index 1)

*Fixed image taking up full size of screen lies behind and is visible through a letterbox and a opache main div 
  This allows for quick loading times as it is just one image and it has good impact(z-index -1)
  
*The main div comprises of a quote at the top of each page which is different promoting the gym further. After the quote the 
page is divided into two main parts in the main display div. The components are left and right containers, columns that extend
infinitely depending on content in them and all content is scaled to the width of the div. The opening times and promotions are added 
as php modules so they can be changed on all webpages with ease and new modules can be added to a div with ease.(z-index 0)

All style sheets and script sheets are external to the HTML. Javascript is used for booking classes and getting membership and there is
a working discount code 'CORP2018' which gives 10% of membership.

Footer is an added php module.
